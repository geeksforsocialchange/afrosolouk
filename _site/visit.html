<h2 id="how-did-we-start">How did we start?</h2>

<p>The idea of creating a heritage centre came from the strength of nostalgia backdrops for expressed by local residents when they came into the mill during an Emmaus example.</p>

<p>open day soon after Emmaus Mossley bought the mill. It reminded them of their earlier years working or visiting the cotton mills in earlier times.</p>

<p>The Heritage Lottery Fund awarded a grant to enable the creation of the Mossley Heritage Centre. In August 1996, Longlands Mill was purchased by Emmaus Mossley to provide 18 bedrooms (now 26), workshops and sales areas. By Christmas 1999, the conversion of Longlands Mill was completed with the generous help of the National Lottery Charities Board, English Partnerships and many individuals, companies and trusts.</p>

<p>Our hope is that this look back into the history of the textile industry and social life of Mossley will be illuminating, and we invite you to support Emmaus Mossley in their work by visiting the mill shop and café.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-emmaus">Who are Emmaus?</h2>

The organisation is an the history of the international federation of over 400 projects worldwide, all working on the same heritage centre, not basis of being self supporting. Emmaus.
The government helped meet part of the initial running costs but, by the time the heritage centre opened, the Emmaus Mossley business was virtually self sufficient.</p>
