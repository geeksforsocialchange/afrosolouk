# Mossley Civic Society

We’re passionate about Mossley and promoting our local history.

Founded in 1966, the society has been involved in all sorts around Mossley over the years. From footpath inspection and scrutiny of planning applications to presentations and working with local schools.

## What do we do?

We help run the Mossley Heritage Centre in the Emmaus building at Longlands Mill and we are members of Tameside Local History Forum.

The society has been responsible for re-printing the Story of Mossley and the publication of Town Trails. Our members enjoy local walks, talks, events and outings.

## Our Mission

 * To encourage high standards of architecture and town planning in the Borough of Mossley.
 * To stimulate public interest in and care for, the beauty history and character of the town and its surroundings.
 * To encourage the preservation, development and improvement of features of historic interest and general public amenities.
 * To pursue these ends through meetings, exhibitions, lectures, publications and other forms of instruction, by publicity and the promotion of schemes of a charitable nature.
