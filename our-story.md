SOM documents the lives of twenty four white women based in Greater Manchester who were in interracial relationships with Africans during the 1940s to 1960s, then the 1960s to 1980s and then 1980s to 2000 which will include Caribbean migration.

Too often the mothers' experiences have been overlooked and they are amazing stories of love, endurance and often rejection by their own families.  Their narratives are important accounts of social attitudes to race relations.

At the end of the 18 month's research, NBAA will publish a book and an eBook available on a dedicated website plus a photographic exhibition. The book will be launched in October 2018 at a special event at Manchester Cathedral which will include a “Talking Head” performance of soliloquies performed by MMU student actors.

NBAA welcomes suggestions of mothers or their surviving family for interviews.
