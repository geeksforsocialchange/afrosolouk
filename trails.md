# Routes to Roots

The Routes to Roots project was funded and created in 2018 through a grant of £35,900 from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF). Thanks to money raised by National Lottery players, the project aims to greatly raise the profile of Mossley Industrial Heritage Centre by increasing visitor numbers and encouraging children and adults to explore the heritage of Mossley in an engaging and fun way.

A very busy few months for the Mossley Civic Society saw us designing five new heritage trails for our town. Volunteers worked alongside Green Monster Arts and pupils from all five primary schools to plot, walk, research stories, create characters and provide a narrative for the trails. A team of 134 project workers with ages ranging from 8 - 84, powered by a shared enthusiasm for heritage trawled the internet, read local books, studied old photos, mined the memories of relatives and explored the archives at the Heritage Centre to ensure that the trails bring the Mossley of the past to life and spark a wider interest in the fantastic history right around us.

## A Goose's Gander

George the Goose and Year 3 pupils at All Saints School took ‘A Gooses’ Gander’ round Micklehurst and uncovered many weird and wonderful facts about people trading jars of wee for cloth and men who were dressed as shepherds but didn’t own any sheep! Their trail takes you back to the very early days of Mossley when otters and eagles visited the valley bottom and stepping stones crossed the river.

## A Dog's Life

Shirley the Sheepdog rounded up the Year 6 children of St Joseph’s School and showed them what ‘A Dog’s Life’ was like in Mossley through the ages. Along the way they met famous people such as George Lawton and Ernest Sykes as well as a former Lord Mayor of Mossley otherwise known as Grandpa Sticks! A link to a small town in Australia was discovered along with the rather stinky details of emptying outside toilets.

## As the Crow Flies

Mr Pickles the Crow and Year 5 at Milton St John’s School flew through the history of our town uncovering romantic adventures, waving men off to war and imagining the sound of hundreds of clogs clattering on cobbles. Pupils found blueprints of mill houses and shared stories from their grandparents, as well as learning about how children of their age would be working in the mills not so long ago. ‘As The Crow Flies’ shares these with you.

## A Bat’s Eye View

Bugler Bat and Beech Class at St George’s School carried out research that took them to the Peninsular and Pyrenees Wars and back to the first Co-op shop in Tameside, travelling by both stagecoach and tram. Uncovering details of the tram crash, the story of Annaville Terrace and the role of Mossley in World War 2 were highlights of ‘A Bat’s Eye View’.

## A Horse’s Tale

Hannah the Horse and Class 3 at Livingstone Primary School will take you on an incredible journey through time, telling ‘A Horse’s Tale’ of war, buns and bonfires! Did you know that there was a murder in the cinema and an attempted bank robbery in Mossley?
