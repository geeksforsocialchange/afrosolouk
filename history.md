# Our History

## Mossley (moss-lea): “the little, hilly, milly, three cornered town” of Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cheshire.

The name ‘Mossley' is derived from two words - ‘moss‘, meaning a bog or swamp, and ‘lea', a clearing in a wood.

In 1750 Mossley was still a hamlet and, at that time, was included in the manor of Ashton without separate existence.

The town came to be situated in three separate counties, with three police forces, three members of Parliament, three county Authorities and three separate County rates! The parts are still defined by the town's parish churches: St George's (Lancashire), St John the Baptist's (Yorkshire) and All Saints (Cheshire).

Hence, the Mossley coat of arms unusually displays the red and white roses each of Lancashire and Yorkshire along with a sheaf of corn denoting Cheshire. The chief industry of the town is represented by a cotton plant with the inscription “He flourishes who labours’.

In 1885, a Charter of Incorporation was granted and, as recently as 1974, Mossley joined Ashton, Audenshaw, Denton, Droylsden, Dukinfield, Hyde, Stalybridge and Longdendale to form the new borough of Tameside in the Metropolitan County of Manchester.

## 19th Century Life

The inevitable introduction of machinery to Mossley's Mills was accompanied by social disturbances in the town and domestic weavers, recognising this threat, scoured the district, breaking down reservoirs and smashing engines and machinery.

The conditions for Mossley‘s factory workers were probably no worse than in other districts: working from six in the morning to eight at night, stopping work at four on Saturdays, for an average wage of 23 shillings a week (£1.15), with one and a half hours a day allowed for mealtimes.

Children were often employed below the legal age of nine - often sent by their parents to supplement the family wage - and beyond the legal hours. These long hours, the stifling atmosphere, insanitary conditions and working by candlelight during long winter evenings all made the life of a factory child in the 1830s and 1840s almost intolerable.

Living conditions were also hard. Large families would live together for years, all sleeping in one bedroom. There was no gas, water or electricity and sanitary arrangements were of the most basic.


## Transporting the goods

The building of the canals, the coming of the railway and the advent of motor transport all played a major part in the success of mossley's textile industries.

As the wool and cotton industries of Mossley grew, developments in transport made for improved trade.

The Huddersfield Narrow Canal was completed in 1811, providing a far more efficient alternative to the road transport of the day - one horse pulling a narrowboat could pull as much weight as 160 pack horses could carry. Mills and factories were built close to the canal for ease of transportation.

A major key to industrial prosperity arrived in 1849 with the opening of the railway, linking Mossley to Manchester. Rail transport soon connected Mossley with Britain's biggest towns and cities and the major ports.

The railway companies later bought the Huddersfield Narrow Canal, after which traffic by water was mostly confined to coal.

Road travel became more important - the railways were still supplemented by horse traffic - and in the 1890s the bicycle became fashionable.

Early in the 20th Century, motor transport came to the town, the first vehicle being a three-wheeled Morgan owned in 1907 by a yarn salesman from Southend Mill. In 1919, the firm of John H Brooks was amongst the first of the town's businesses to operate a motor lorry.

In 1904 an electric tramway system was introduced, followed in 1925 by the start of motor bus services, and private and commercial motor transport were soon to become more and more commonplace.

## Cotton waste

From 1928 until its closure, Longlands Mill was occupied by John H Brooks, cotton waste merchants.

During the cotton famine of 1861, caused by the American Civil War and the blockade of raw cotton supplies at southern American ports, the Mayall family sought a good supplier of high grade Egyptian cotton waste from Lancashire Mills to keep the mills open.

Cotton waste is a by-product of the spinning process.

The firm of John H Brooks started a waste cotton works in Top Mossley during the American Civil War and became supplier to many mills in the region. They operated from Longlands Mill between 1929 and 1989.

Willowing was a very important part of the business and involved the cleaning of lower grades of cotton waste for bedding, upholstery and low-count yarn spinning. Ironically, much of the material was exported to America for the motor industry!

Processing of superior grades of cotton waste was also carried out for the Yorkshire woollen industry.

(Postscript - J. Harold Brooks, the grandson of the founder of the firm, joined Terry Waite and Roy Etchells, the Town Mayor, at the opening of this Heritage Centre in September 2001. He and his wife said how pleased they are that their old mill has been saved from dereliction and turned to such good use.)
