# Bat at St. Georges 1921

John had been a brave soldier and with Bugler had been on many adventures during the Peninsular and Pyrenees Wars. Between 1815 to 1825 John blew his bugle and beat his drum. Bugler would stay hidden in his hat and John reckoned that his good fortune was down to having a lucky bat in his hat!
